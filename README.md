## Description
The Horiseon homepage code was written using undifferentiated container tags and relied heavily on broad class declarations for styling of elements.  Key elements were simply missing and several changes were needed to optimize it for search engines and to bring the codebase in line with accesibility standards.  My task is to refactor the code to solve these issues and publish my solution using Git and GitHub.

- The html code was divided using undifferentiated containers making the site hard to navigate future development difficult.
- The code file is extensively commented much of the commenting is explanatory for the actual and real purposes of this course assignment and some of it is for the formal purpose of the assignment, providing an easy-to-maintain codebase to a client.
- The CSS code utilized class declarations which were to braod an approach to styling the webpage. If utilized in future development, tracing the effects of the CSS could become exceedingly difficult.
- Completing this project has deepened my understanding of coding in a cooperative setting.
- I attempted to satisfy the spirit of the asignment by going beyond the elements we have been exposed to and I discovered what seems to me to be current state-of-art limitations. While I was able to use an ARIA attribute to describe the Hero section background image, and I was able to substitue an SVG to achieve a more desireable utterance from the screen reader, I could find no way to sensibly package abbreviations. I believe the accesibility standards should go beyond mere functionality to be truly inclusive. 
- I practiced commentting with the intent todo so both meaningfully and concisely (In places I used precisely duplicate comments as they easily removed with the find/replace function.)
- Through working on this project, I have learned about the experience of persons who use assistive technologies to access the site by auditing the site with a screen reader.  I have also learned several of the factors considered by search engine providers when generating search results through online research.  Most of all, I have spent time considering the many different ways code can be used to achieve similar results and what makes efficient code.

## Installation
To set up the website:
 - upload the index.html file along with the assets folder and all of its contents to the host server
## Usage
Use this webpage as the landing page of a more extensive website.  A companies presence on the web can provide brand awareness, lead generation, sales, and much more.  I have attached a screenshot of the web page with a simple wire frame highlighting the areas of the website that I improved.

## Credits
This project began with the work of many others working for [Trilogy Education Services](https://www.trilogyed.com/) and [The School of Continuing Studies, University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/). After completing a couple weeks of their Full Stack Coding Boot Camp, including detailed online modules and just a few hours of live online instructor lead classes, I feel confident that I was able to significantly improve the code of this website.  I'd also like to mention Mr. Banks, my highschool computer science teacher.  He deserses my recognition for his dedication to the teaching profession - it was well above average.  And finally, I'd like to thank Nick Maes.  I would not be here without his care and concern.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [MIT License](License.md).

## Features
My refactor of the website includes a custom SVG file to solve the clients desire for a simple two color text branding of the compnay name while providing screen reader support on the website header that doesn't produce an off-color utterance.
I've also included extensive (but uniform) notes explaining the changes I made for the people who matter even more than my imaginary client! :)
