# <Your-Project-Title>Horiseon Homepage Refactor
## Description
The Horiseon homepage code was written using undifferentiated container tags and relied heavily on broad class declarations for styling of elements.  Key elements were simply missing and several changes were needed to optimize it for search engines and to bring the codebase in line with accesibility standards.

- The html code was divided using undifferentiated containers making the site hard to navigate future development difficult
- The code file is extensively commented much of the commenting is explanatory for the actual and real purposes of this course assignment and some of it is for the pretended fromal purpose of providing an easy-to-maintain codebase to a client
- The CSS code exceedingly utilized broad class declarations which would complicate future development as it would lead to greater and greater difficulty to trace the CSS impact on the styling of HTML elements in the future.
- I built this project to challenge and deepen my understanding of coding in a work environment and I attempted to go above and beyond the elements we have already been shown.  Specifically I included an ARIA attribute to describe the Hero section background image since, I believe the accesibility standards must go beyond mere functionality to be truly inclusive and I atempted to comment the code meaningfully and concisely (precisely duplicate comments are easily removed with the find/replace function.)
- Through working on this project, I have learned about the experience of persons who use assistive technologies to access the site by auditing the site with a screen reader.  I have also learned several of the factors considered by search engine providers when generating search results.  Most of all, I have spent time considering the many different ways code can be used and what makes efficient code.

## Installation
To set up the website:
 - upload the index.html file along with the assets folder and all of its contents to the host server
## Usage
Use this webpage as the landing page of a more extensive website.  A companies presence on the web can provide brand awareness, lead generation, sales, and much more.  I have attached a screenshot of the web page with a simple wire frame highlighting the areas of the website that I improved.

## Credits
This project began with the work of many others working for [Trilogy Education Services](https://www.trilogyed.com/) and [The School of Continuing Studies, University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/). After completing a couple weeks of their Full Stack Coding Boot Camp, including detailed online modules and just a few hours of live online instructor lead classes, I feel confident that I was able to significantly improve the code of this website.  I'd also like to mention Mr. Banks, my highschool computer science teacher.  He deserses my recognition for his dedication to the teaching profession - it was well above average.  And finally, I'd like to thank Nick Maes.  I would not be here without his care and concern.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [MIT License](License.md).

## Features
My refactor of the website includes a custom SVG file to solve the clients desire for a simple two color text branding of the compnay name while providing screen reader support on the website header that doesn't produce an off-color utterance.
