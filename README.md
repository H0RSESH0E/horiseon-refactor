## Description
The Horiseon website homepage code was written using undifferentiated container tags and relied heavily on class declarations for styling of specific elements.  Key semantic elements were simply missing and several changes were needed to optimize it for search engines and to bring the codebase in line with accesibility standards.  While specific details of the assignment are confidential and proprietary, in short, my task was to refactor the code to solve these issues and publish my solution using GitHub and GitHub Pages. 

The following is a short description of my experience completing the project:

- The html code was divided using undifferentiated containers making the site hard to navigate future development difficult.
- The CSS code utilized class declarations which were too broad an approach to styling the webpage. If they were utilized in future development, tracing the effects of the CSS could become exceedingly complicated and difficult.
- I left the code file extensively commented to serve both the imaginary and real purposes of this assignment. My aim was to provide an easy-to-maintain codebase for my imaginary client and a easy-to-grade codebase for my graders.
- To satisfy the spirit of the assignment I pushed myself to go beyond the elements we have been exposed to in class. I think I may have found limitations in the current state-of-the-art accessibility technologies. I was able to use an ARIA attribute to describe the Hero section background image, and I was able to substitute an SVG to achieve a more desirable utterance from the screen reader, however I could find no way to sensibly package abbreviations. I believe developers must continue to push to improve accessibility beyond mere adequate functionality toward a rich experience to achieve equitable inclusivity.
- I practiced commenting trying to be both meaningful and concise (In several places I used precisely duplicate comments as they are easily removed with the find/replace function.)
- Completing this project has deepened my understanding of coding in a cooperative setting where I will need to interpret and anticipate the needs and concerns of past, present and future stakeholders. I hope I have correctly anticipated the needs of my graders.
- Through working on this project, I have learned about the experience of persons who use assistive technologies to access the site by auditing the site with a screen reader.  
- I have also learned several of the factors considered by search engine providers when generating search results through online research.  
- Most of all, I have spent time considering the many different ways code can be used to achieve similar results and what makes efficient code.


## Installation
To set up the website:
 - upload the index.html file along with the assets folder and all of its contents to the host server. 
## Usage
Use this webpage as the landing page of a more extensive website.  A company's presence on the web can provide brand awareness, lead generation, sales, and much more.

## Credits
This project began with the work of many others working for [Trilogy Education Services](https://www.trilogyed.com/) and [The School of Continuing Studies, University of Toronto](https://learn.utoronto.ca/). After completing a couple weeks of their Full Stack Coding Boot Camp, including detailed online modules and just a few hours of live online instructor-led classes, I feel confident that I was able to significantly improve the code of this website.  I'd also like to mention Mr. Banks, my highschool computer science teacher.  He deserves my recognition for his dedication to the teaching profession - it was well above average.  And finally, I'd like to thank Nick Maes.  I would not be here without his care and concern.

## Features
My refactor of the Horiseon website includes a custom SVG file that resolves my clients desire for a simple two color text branding of the company name while providing screen readers with content that doesn't lead to an off-color utterance when it is supposed to be the company's name.
